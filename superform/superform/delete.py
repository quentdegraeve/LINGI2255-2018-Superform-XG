delete(id, idc) will first query the plugin and its channel from the the database, using @id of the post, in order to 
get the concerned module.
It then calls the deletable() method of the concerned module. If true, the delete(pub) method is called
from the module, and then delete it from the database. Otherwise, it will call can_be_deleted(id, idc) to 
ask the module if the publishing can be deleted from the database anyway.
Eventually, delete(id) tries to query any publishing from the post which id is @id. If the result
is null, then the post is deleted from database.
